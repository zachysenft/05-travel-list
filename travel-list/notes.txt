State vs Props

State
-> internal data, owned by component
-> Component "memory"
-> can be updated by the component itself
-> updating state causes component to re-render
-> used to make components interactive


Props
-> external data, owned by parent component
-> similar to function parameters
-> read-only
-> receiving new props causes component to re-render, usually when the parent's state has been updated
-> used by parent to configure child component ("settings")
